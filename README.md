# writeups

There are quite a few ready to be published, but waiting for the labs to Retire to post.

CTF write-ups are from SOLO CTFs, which I rarely do. Team CTF's I have my specific category where I specialize in, so posting 1/8 of the whole CTF doesn't seem worthwhile.

HTB write-ups contain only labs I've done where I've learned something significant or ran into something interesting. Posting almost identical easy level lab write-ups won't help anyone. Also these write-ups only come out when the lab is about to retire or is already RETIRED, according to HTB's TOS, to not ruin the challenge of others by giving away answers.

THM rooms are a rare occurrence as it's content is mostly tailored to newer people. When there's one I find interesting I'll add them.
